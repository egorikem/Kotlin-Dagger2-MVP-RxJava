# Kotlin-Dagger2-MVP-RxJava
Learning an all-new Kotlin language, I had a desire to write something neat what I have been doing all the time with Java, rather
that having simple stuff.

This project utilizes stack of top-notch technologies such as: ```Dagger2, RxJava, MVP pattern```.

Feel free to copy this code for any purposes ;)
